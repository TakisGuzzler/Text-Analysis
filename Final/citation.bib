abstract = {Previous diachronic studies of lexical changes in academic writing have focused on the evolution of specific sets or classes of words with specific grammatical or discourse functions, with no scholarly attention paid to diachronic changes in the overall lexical complexity of academic writing, a construct that has been shown to be closely related to text readability and writing quality. This study explores diachronic lexical complexity changes in academic writing based on a self-built corpus, the Corpus of Nature Biology Letters, comprised of 421 scientific letters sampled with ten-year intervals for 100 years (1929–2019). The corpus was analyzed for nine measures of lexical density, sophistication, and diversity to ascertain the trend and strength of lexical complexity changes. Our findings show that the patterns of diachronic changes in the lexical complexity of academic writing accord with the overall trends in academic writing towards greater compression and conventionalization. These findings add to our understanding of the evolution of the academic writing practices of the scientific community and may also have implications for academic writing pedagogy.}

abstract = {The majority of current lexical richness indices are based on Indo-European languages, especially English, with a lack of research that investigates their applicability to diverse language types. This study examines the applicability of 44 lexical richness indices, based on Indo-European languages, to Chinese, with a specific emphasis on investigating their predictive power for the writing quality of Chinese as a Foreign Language (CFL) learners. The present study reveals that five indices (Number of Different Words, Uber Index, Corrected Verb Variation1, Lexical Frequency Profile, and Verb Sophistication1) assessing English as a second language (L2) can also effectively predict the writing quality of CFL learners, and six indices (Verb Variation, Verb Variation1, Function Words Ratio_ auxiliary, Function Words Ratio_ pronoun, Lexical Density1, and Lexical Density2) may be more suitable for measuring Chinese, but not English. Moreover, transformed indices demonstrate a better capacity to measure L2 Chinese compared to traditional indices. In conducting a preliminary exploration of effective indices for measuring the lexical richness of Chinese interlanguage, this study emphasizes their potential impact on L2 teaching and suggests directions for future research.}

abstract = {The present study investigates four kinds of lexical diversity measurement and a computational experiment with corpus processing and statistical test has been conducted to find out the most effective lexical diversity measurement in evaluating a small-sized corpus of 350 ~ 550 words. The results show that the D-estimate is the most appropriate among the four lexical diversity measurements which were compared in this research. Also the D-estimate showed more stable results than other measurements when the number of words varied between texts. The D-estimate was applied to measure the morphological and grammatical diversities of L2 learners of the Korean language, and conduct a statistical test on whether the mother tongues of L2 learners affect the degree of acquisition of grammatical morphemes. The test shows that the native languages of L2 learners learning Korean did not seem to have a significant impact.}
