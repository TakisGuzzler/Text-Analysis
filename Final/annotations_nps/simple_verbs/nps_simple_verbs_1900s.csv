i do n't feel,4,NVMV,11522,11525,4
it was,2,NV,11528,11529,2
to turn my hand,4,MVNN,11532,11535,4

i 'm getting really fond of the room,8,NVVMPPDN,11634,11641,8
getting really fond of the room in spite,8,VMPPDNPN,11636,11643,8
wallpaper it dwells in my mind,6,NNVPNN,11651,11656,6
i lie here on this great immovable bed,8,NVMPDAAN,11658,11665,8
it is nailed down i,5,NVVMN,11667,11671,5
i believe,2,NV,11671,11672,2
follow that pattern,3,VDN,11675,11677,3
hour it is as,4,NNVM,11681,11684,4
gymnastics i assure you i,5,NNVNN,11687,11691,5
you i start we,4,NNVN,11690,11693,4
we 'll say at the bottom,6,NVVPDN,11693,11698,6
it has not been touched,5,NVMVV,11706,11710,5
i determine for the thousandth time that i,8,NVPDANNN,11712,11719,8
thousandth time that i will follow,6,ANNNVV,11716,11721,6
time that i will follow that pointless pattern,8,NNNVVDAN,11717,11724,8
will follow that pointless pattern to some sort,8,VVDANPDN,11720,11727,8
sort of a conclusion i know a little,8,NPDNNVDN,11727,11734,8
conclusion i know a little of the principle,8,NNVDNPDN,11730,11737,8
know a little of the principle of design,8,VDNPDNPN,11732,11739,8
i know this thing,4,NVDN,11741,11744,4
thing was not arranged on any laws,7,NVMVPDN,11744,11750,7
was not arranged on any laws of radiation,8,VMVPDNPN,11745,11752,8
i ever heard,3,NMV,11763,11765,3
it is repeated of course by the breadths,8,NVVMMPDN,11767,11774,8
not otherwise looked at in one way,7,MMVPPAN,11776,11782,7
breadth stands alone the bloated curves,6,NVMDAN,11784,11789,6
debased romanesque,2,VN,11797,11798,2
other hand they connect diagonally,5,ANNVM,11817,11821,5
sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves,8,NNVPPANN,11824,11831,8
optic horror like a lot of wallowing seaweeds,8,ANPDNPVN,11833,11840,8
lot of wallowing seaweeds in full chase,7,NPVNPAN,11837,11843,7
whole thing goes horizontally too at least it,8,ANVMMMMN,11845,11852,8
it seems so,3,NVM,11852,11854,3
i exhaust myself,3,NVN,11856,11858,3
trying to distinguish the order of its,7,VMVDNPN,11860,11866,7
order of its going in that direction they,8,NPNVPDNN,11864,11871,8
direction they have used a horizontal breadth,7,NNVVDAN,11870,11876,7
have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze,8,VVDANPDN,11872,11879,8
that adds wonderfully to the confusion there,7,NVMPDNN,11881,11887,7
confusion there is one end of the room,8,NNVANPDN,11886,11893,8
it is almost,3,NVM,11895,11897,3
cross lights fade,3,NNV,11903,11905,3
it i can almost fancy radiation,6,NNVMAN,11913,11918,6
interminable grotesques seem to form,5,ANVMV,11923,11927,5
grotesques seem to form around a common centre,8,NVMVPDAN,11924,11931,8
rush off in headlong plunges of equal distraction,8,VPPANPAN,11933,11940,8
headlong plunges of equal distraction it makes me,8,ANPANNVN,11936,11943,8
to follow it i,4,MVNN,11945,11948,4
it i will take a nap i,7,NNVVDNN,11947,11953,7
nap i guess i,4,NNVN,11952,11955,4
i do n't know why i,6,NVMVMN,11955,11960,6
i should write this i,5,NVVNN,11960,11964,5

i know john would think it,6,NVMVVN,11975,11980,6
i must say what i,5,NVVNN,11983,11987,5
what i feel,3,NNV,11986,11988,3

great effort for me to think straight just,8,ANPNMVMM,12147,12154,8

me it used to disturb me,6,NNVMVN,13955,13960,6
i thought seriously,3,NVM,13963,13965,3
burning the house,3,VDN,13967,13969,3
to reach the smell,4,MVDN,13971,13974,4
i am used to it,5,NVVPN,13977,13981,5
only thing i can think,5,ANNVV,13983,13987,5
it is,2,NV,13990,13991,2
is the color of the paper,6,VDNPDN,13993,13998,6
yellow smell there is,4,ANNV,14000,14003,4
streak that runs round the room it,7,NNVPDNN,14017,14023,7
room it goes behind every piece of furniture,8,NNVPDNPN,14022,14029,8
it had been rubbed,4,NVVV,14040,14043,4
i wonder how it,4,NVMN,14047,14050,4
it was done,3,NVV,14050,14052,3
who did it,3,NVN,14054,14056,3
what they did it for round,6,NNVNPN,14058,14063,6
it makes me,3,NVN,14075,14077,3
me dizzy i,3,NVN,14077,14079,3
i really have discovered something at last through,8,NMVVNPAN,14079,14086,8
something at last through watching so,6,NPANVM,14083,14088,6
it changes so i,4,NVMN,14093,14096,4
i have finally found out the front pattern,8,NVMVPDAN,14096,14103,8
front pattern does move,4,ANVV,14102,14105,4
no wonder the woman behind shakes it,7,MVDNPNN,14108,14114,7

bright spots she keeps still,5,ANNVM,14145,14149,5
shady spots she just takes hold,6,ANNMVN,14154,14159,6

time trying to climb,4,NVMV,14172,14175,4
nobody could climb through that pattern,6,NVVPDN,14178,14183,6
it strangles so i,4,NVMN,14185,14188,4
i think that,3,NVN,14188,14190,3
that is why it,4,NVMN,14190,14193,4
it has so many heads they,6,NVMANN,14193,14198,6
many heads they get through,5,ANNVM,14196,14200,5

him run again,3,NVM,39378,39380,3
