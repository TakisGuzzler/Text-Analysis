this and i succeeded in regulating the movement,8,NCNVCVDN,6714,6721,8

there are two distinct forces in us that,8,NVAANPNN,6782,6789,8
that is a movement and a regulator,7,NVDNCDN,6799,6805,7
soul is the principle of life that,7,NVDNPNN,6807,6813,7

next morning touching his history,5,ANVNN,39955,39959,5
he declined to answer them,5,NVMVN,39963,39967,5
